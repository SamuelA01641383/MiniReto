<p><em>"In desperate times, conscripted criminals refill our ranks. Sometimes, however, you find a diamond in the rough. The most elite earn their name: Conquerors. 
    Strong as a battering ram, resilient as a fortress gate, their flail is as dangerous to the wielder as it is to the enemy. But in the right hands it becomes... unstoppable."</em></p>


<p>Ex-prisoners and forced conscripts who have risen to the rank of elite soldier. Originally pressed into military service as sword fodder, those who are skilled enough to survive are 
    promoted out of the rank and file and given heavy infantry training. They are heavily armored warriors, relying on a defensive style with their Heater Shield and their massive flails 
    to whittle away at their opponents until they fall under the Conquerors massive onslaught. Climbing from the lowest ranked to this prestigious role in the Knights forces, 
    Conquerors have earned the respect of their peers through determination and feats of arms.</p>
