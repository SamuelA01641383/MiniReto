<p><em>"Where order has broken down, where cruelty and lawlessness rule, Lawbringers are justice. They go wherever they are needed, 
    and they come prepared. Their armor has no equal, its construction a secret of their order. And they carry the most versatile weapon ever invented: the poleaxe. 
    Pray that you do not need them. And when they arrive, pray that you have done no wrong."</em></p>


<p>The Lawbringers are justice in Ashfeld. They enforce the laws and dispense punishment and retribution without mercy. Their armor is without equal, their signature 
    weapon a grim reminder of the ultimate punishment for lawlessness. They will go wherever they are needed, pray that you are on the right side when they arrive.</p>
