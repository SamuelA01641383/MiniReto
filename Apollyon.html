<p>Apollyon is the main antagonist in the Story Campaign mode of For Honor. She serves as the final boss of the Samurai Story and, by extension, the entire Campaign.</p>
<p>The undisputed Warlord of the Blackstone Legion, through her the Blackstones have come to rule Ashfeld. She admires the warriors of all three factions but is disgusted 
    that they have begun setting aside their warring ways in favor of peace. She intends to start a new age of war by turning the three factions and their leaders against 
    each other. She wishes to usher in, as she calls it, "an age of wolves," viewing the groups that are willing to go to war as wolves who will fight for survival and the 
    ones who favor peace as sheep waiting to be slaughtered.</p>
