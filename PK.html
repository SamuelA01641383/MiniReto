<p>The Peacekeepers are a military police group that serve as secret police during times of peace, and assassins during times of war.</p>

<p>The Peacekeepers are an exclusively female military police group. During times of peace, they are tasked with law enforcement. However, 
    instead of conducting arrests Peacekeepers perform their duties by acting as a type of death squad and silently eliminating threats to the peace. 
    However, when wars start they use their skills to silently eliminate high value targets ranging from political heads to military leaders. They are 
    skilled in not just assassination but scouting, infiltration, espionage, and sabotage.</p>
