<p>Hervis Daubeny was a warlord and the former master of the Warden in the campaign. He was a former knight of the Blackstone Legion but he only remained with the 
    Legion for one season before leaving and taking what he could from the Blackstone Legion in the process. Enraged by Daubeny's theft and desertion, Apollyon sent 
    Holden Cross to punish him. Daubeny's forces were overwhelmed and Holden Cross challenged the former Blackstone to a trial by combat. Seeing that Holden was no match 
    for him, he called the challenge an 'execution'. Cross presented his second, Ademar, as a replacement combatant and Daubeny chose the Warden as his. The Warden emerged
     victorious, and Cross spared Daubeny after knighting the Warden as a knight of the Blackstone Legion and giving him/her Daubeny's sword.</p>
